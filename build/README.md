## Terraform

### plan

The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. The plan can be saved using -out, and then provided to terraform apply to ensure only the pre-planned actions are executed.

```
terraform plan -out customer.plan
```

### apply

The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.


```
terraform apply
```
